# Music Starter Kit
You can make music and record it in high quality, anywhere, without disturbing
your neighbors. Professional music production used to be prohibitively
expensive. Today, it's within many people's budgets.

## What do I really need?
Everyone will benefit from having a [nice pair of
headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000AJIF4E "Sony MDR-7506: $90"). A
percussionist may only need [drum sticks and a practice
pad](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07W6NXZ15 "$18"). A vocalist may want a
microphone and a multitrack recorder. A guitarist may want an [electric
guitar](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07TFR8XBR "Squier Telecaster: $178") and
[amplifier](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00CD2PQKW "Vox Mini5: $152"). Choose
what makes sense for you.

## How much should I spend?
Start with the least expensive option that works for you, then upgrade as
needed. A smartphone with a [recording app](https://www.apple.com/music-memos/
"Music Memos: $0") is better than nothing. This guide is for when you want to
level up.

## Silence is Golden
Headphones, electric guitars, digital pianos, and digital drums allow you to
practice *quietly*.

## Recording
You want to record each instrument on a separate track, so you can adjust their
volume independently. Your recording equipment determines how many instruments
you can record at once.

You can record and mix music using a computer, or a multitrack recorder, or
both. Use a multitrack recorder at a venue, then copy the tracks to a computer
for mixing later. It's up to you. If you don't have a computer, and don't want
to buy one, a multitrack recorder will work fine.

You will need an audio interface to plug microphones and instruments into a
computer.
