# Music Starter Kit

These are some inexpensive, high quality musical instruments. However, they may need a slight [truss rod adjustment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdr6rJVSSx54ByuY5U2ohTQ "StewMac's guitar repair YouTube channel").

I've chosen what I think is the best value: not the least expensive, but close. Quality is a must.

Each option has more expensive alternatives. If you want to record yourself singing and playing guitar at the same time, you might want the 2-channel version of the audio interface I've suggested.
