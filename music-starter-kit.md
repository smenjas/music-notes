# Music Starter Kit

These are some inexpensive, high quality musical instruments. However, they may need a slight [truss rod adjustment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdr6rJVSSx54ByuY5U2ohTQ "StewMac's guitar repair YouTube channel").

I've chosen what I think is the best value: not the least expensive, but close. Quality is a must.

Each option has more expensive alternatives. If you want to record yourself singing and playing guitar at the same time, you might want the 2-channel version of the audio interface I've suggested.

Prices are from April 8th, 2020, rounded to the nearest dollar.

If you want to record, but have no idea what computer setup to use, and want a recommendation that works for most beginners, I suggest a [2020 MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) & [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) ($999+, $899+ if you're a student.

If you want more, like wireless microphones, professional recording studios, and walls of sound, that requires your own research.
